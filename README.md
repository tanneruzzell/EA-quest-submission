## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quests
### 1. Explain what the blockchain is in your own words.
#### The blockchains is a open, public, decentralized database. This is the technology used for networks like bitcoin, ethereum, and Flow. The data is protected by its openness
### 2. Explain what a smart contract is
#### A smart contract is a function that does something on a blockchain. For instance, I could set up a smart contract that sends someone else 5 dollars, and with custom parameters, anyone could use my smart contract.
### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
#### Scripts are used just to observe data on the blockchain and they are completely free. Transaction are used to change data on the blockchain and they are not free.
## Chapter 1 Day 2 Quests
### 1. What are the 5 Cadance Programming Language Pillars
#### 1. Safety and security - the blockchain costs real money, so contracts must be safe and secure
#### 2. Clarity - Makes sure code is easy to read and interpret
#### 3. Approachibility- Written similar to other programming languages, so many people can transition easily
#### 4. Developer Experience - Clear error messages, over all readible/ sensible language.
#### 5. Recouce Oriented Programming - Cadence at its core uses recources... that define everything we do on flow. 
### 2. Why are theses pillar useful
#### With many new languages popping up for Web3.0, its importat that things are made purposefully, like flow. These pillar outline why cadance was made, and how developers should build with cadence.

## Chapter 2 Day 2
### 1. Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.
#### Scripts are used for observing the blockchain, NOT for changing it. It wouldn't make sense to call a function that changes the blockchain from a script.
### 2. What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?
#### In flow, each account can store their own accounts data, so it's very important that the account running the transaction is explicitally noted. This is what the AuthAccount field does.
### 3. What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?
#### Because each account can store their own data via flow, we use to prepare phase to collect/ format the data they way we need to for the transcation. The execute phase will then complete the transaction, but is not tecnically nessecary because everything it does, the prepare phase can do.
### 4. What we did but with a number:
